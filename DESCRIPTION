Description: FHIR R4 bundles in JSON format are derived from https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads.
	Transformation inspired by a kaggle notebook published by Dr
	Alexander Scarlat, 
	https://www.kaggle.com/code/drscarlat/fhir-starter-parse-healthcare-bundles-into-tables.
	This is a very limited illustration of some basic parsing and reorganization
	processes.  Additional tooling will be required to move beyond the Synthea data illustrations.
